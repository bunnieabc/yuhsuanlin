  <h2>Talk To Figure</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <div class="image-sm"><img src="/assets/img/figure/p2.png" alt=""></div>
  <p>This exhibit is designed to reveal immense history behind 227 Abolitionist Place Museum Heritage Center which is located in NYC. The goal of this project is to allow visitors to learn the history of African American and the Underground Railroad in NYC without too much reading. We build an interactive exhibit which can allow people to communicate with the abolitionist through a telephone. Also, visitors can watch the stereoscope to view the historical situation. The exhibit also serves to raise awareness of the roots of slavery in New York.</p>

  <h3>Preliminary Research</h3>
  <div class="image-sm"><img src="/assets/img/figure/p4.png" alt=""></div>
  <p>
    New York was the second largest slave-owning state in the nation during the 1800s, but the area of Downtown Brooklyn was once an enclave of abolitionist activity. 227 Abolitionist Place was one of the safe houses along the Underground Railway for African-Americans and escaping slavery. After passing through several generations, the house was owned by Joy Chatel in 1998. <br><br>

However, when I visited 227 Duffield Street, I found that this heritage center was close and Joy Chatel who passed away in 2014. Now her daughter takes over the heritage center. Since it is impossible to enter the museum recently, I decided to focus more on the general experience of visiting a historical museum.
