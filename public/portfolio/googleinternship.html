  <h2>Google UX Design Internship</h2>
  <br>
  <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
  <p>In summer 2018, I worked as UX Design Intern with Google Assistant team, designing engaging answer for Google Smart Display. Considering the timespan of the project which was 12 weeks, I mainly focused on designing interactions for music/musician’s answer. I collaborated with UX researchers, VUI designers, GUI designers and UX engineers to research and design the feature. Due to NDA, <strong>I cannot disclose details of the feature</strong>, but I can share the high level process and what I learned from the internship.<br><br></p>

      First of all, we found out the opportunity of designing engaging answer for musicians/music based on existing user data. <br>
      Before I worked on the project, I set up 1:1s with my team to learn about the project scope. In the 1:1 meetings, I learned about their background and projects, culture of Google, the resources which are related to my project. They also introduced people who might be helpful for my project to me. I gained a better understanding of our team’s work style and where to find resources through the meetings

      <br>
      This project is based on data from a smart school website, NCTU Plus, for which I served as designer and developer. On NCTU Plus, students can find course information and comments provided by former students.<br>

        I created PLUSME and focused more on real-time experience and mobile experience, integrating timetable, real-time events, and chat room features into the app.

  <h3>Design</h3>
  <br>
  <h4>UI Flow</h4>
  <p>After defining the problems, I created an UI flow to organize information architecture.<br><br></p>
  <div class="image-sm">
    <img src="/assets/img/plusme/p10.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <br><br><br>
  <h4>Wireframes</h4>
  <p>Then I create wireframe to make all information in the app more clear and understandable.</p>
  <br>

  <div class="other-sm flex">
    <div class="col-60 text-left ">
      <div class="title">Evaluate Functions and Flow</div>
      <br>
      After I finished wireframes, I use POP to transform the wireframes into a real working prototype. I selected 3 tasks and 2 users to be tested in order to identify usability problems, during which the user is probed to explain their expectations and problems. Following that, I found that the chat room's interface was a little confusing so I simplified the interface after considerable evaluation.

  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
  <h4>Usability Tests</h4>
  <p>I assess learnability, satisfaction, and effectiveness of PLUSME by making up 3 task-scenarios and asking 6 subjects to accomplish the tasks. I kept records of the problems they encountered while using the app and measured the time they spent on each tasks.</p>
  <br>
  <div class="image-sm">
    <img src="/assets/img/plusme/p14.png" alt="">
  </div>
  <br><br>
  <h4>Results</h4>
  <p>From the evaluation, I discovered that most of the users can easily find out the upcomming events and course's summaries. However, since the members' list is at third level, one user spent double time on searching for the members' list. <br>
  Moreover, one interviewee indicated that she had concern with the feature of sending message to others since she is afriad that students may be harassed by strangers. To solve the problem, I will allow users to change their privacy setting in their profile page.</p>
  <br><br><br>
  <h4>Concept Video</h4>
  <p> I made a Lego animation to demonstrate scenarios and introduce the concept of PLUSME. To elaborate its features, I created 4 sub-stories.
